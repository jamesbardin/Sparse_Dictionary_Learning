# Sparse_Dictionary_Learning

Steps:
- Load the input images using a library such as OpenCV or PIL.
- Convert the images to grayscale if necessary, using a library such as cv2.
- Convert the image data to a matrix form, where each column represents a flattened image.
- Normalize the image data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
- Initialize a dictionary of atoms, either randomly or using a predefined set of basis functions.
- Use an optimization algorithm such as k-SVD or OMP to learn the dictionary atoms and sparse representation coefficients.
- Evaluate the reconstruction quality by measuring the residual error between the input images and their sparse representations using the learned dictionary.
- Repeat steps 6-7 with different numbers of dictionary atoms to determine the optimal number of atoms for reconstruction.
